description: "Catherine: A Story was the first full-length work of fiction produced\
  \ by William Makepeace Thackeray. It first appeared in serialized installments in\
  \ Fraser's Magazine between May 1839 and February 1840, credited to \"Ikey Solomons,\
  \ Esq. Junior\". Thackeray's original intention in writing it was to criticize the\
  \ Newgate school of crime fiction, exemplified by Bulwer-Lytton and Harrison Ainsworth,\
  \ whose works Thackeray felt glorified criminals. Thackeray even included Dickens\
  \ in this criticism for his portrayal of the good-hearted streetwalker Nancy and\
  \ the charming pickpocket, the Artful Dodger, in Oliver Twist.\nAinsworth's Jack\
  \ Sheppard portrayed a real life prison breaker and thief from the eighteenth century\
  \ in flattering terms. In contrast, Thackeray sought out a real life criminal whom\
  \ he could portray in as unflattering terms as possible. He settled on Catherine\
  \ Hayes, another eighteenth-century criminal, who was burned at the stake for murdering\
  \ her husband in 1726. However, as he told his mother, Thackeray developed a \"\
  sneaking kindness\" for his heroine, and the novel that was supposed to present\
  \ criminals as totally vile, without any redeeming characteristics, instead made\
  \ Catherine and her roguish companions seem rather appealing. Thackeray felt the\
  \ result was a failure, and did not republish it in his lifetime.\n From Wikipedia\
